# âœ¨ðŸª¶ Connexiful (as of December 20, 2024)  
(kon-NEK-si-ful, kon-NEX-si-ful)  

adj., A state or quality of deep and meaningful interconnectedness, often characterized by a felt sense. Used to describe hard-to-define experiences that evoke a sense of connection with the world, with others or within one's self. 

Usage:
- "There was a palpable connexiful energy in the room, like a sense of everyone being on the same wavelength."
- "My friend and I had a weird connexiful moment when we said the exact same thing at the exact same time."
-  "I had a strong connexiful feeling when I realized my place within the network around me."

Synonyms:
interconnected, interwoven, synergistic, harmonious, resonant

Antonyms:
isolated, disconnected, fragmented, alienated

Origin:
Coined by Google Bard, a large language model, on December 28, 2023. I prompted the language model to create a new word to describe "an ineffable sense of connection." A quick Google Search showed zero results for connexiful, so here we are. It's now on Urban Dictionary so it's practically real now.
